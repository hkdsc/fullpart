We present a new part-based 3D generation framework *FullPart* that combines both implicit and explicit paradigms. 

<!-- ![image_2](assets/framework5.png) -->

And we introduce the largest and most comprehensively annotated 3D part dataset *PartVerse-XL*, an upgraded version of [*PartVerse*](https://copart3d.github.io/), from 12K/91K to 40K/320K objects/parts.

The code and dataset will be released before Nov 7th.
